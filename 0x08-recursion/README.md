# 0x08. C - Recursion
---

This directory is about function recursion,which is the ability of the function to call itself,by breaking its main objectives into smaller pieces until required result is achieved amd finally returning the results into the calling function then the calling function returns into main function. A recursive function must have a code base to prevent infinite loop unless the function returns void.
